-Hello! I am a Computer Science student at Kennesaw Sate with a concentration towards Artificial Intelligence/Machine Vision and Machine Learning. I thoroughly enjoy developing software and working across the stack as I can let my creativity flow in finding rare but efficient solutions. I have extensive experience using Python and Java and have used C#, HTML, CSS, SQL to an intermediate extent but I am always willing to learn new languages and concepts. I plan on graduating in Spring 2022 with a completed B.S but as of right now, I am actively looking to gain real life work experience through internship opportunities.
